Other info:
 
        Jenkins will be launched as a daemon on startup. See /etc/init.d/jenkins for more details.
        The 'jenkins' user is created to run this service. If you change this to a different user via the config file, you must change the owner of /var/log/jenkins, /var/lib/jenkins, and /var/cache/jenkins.
        Log file will be placed in /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log. Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
        /etc/sysconfig/jenkins will capture configuration parameters for the launch.
        By default, Jenkins listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.  Note that the built-in firewall may have to be opened to access this port from other computers.  (See http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/disable-linux-firewall-under-centos-rhel-fedora/ for instructions how to disable the firewall permanently)
        A Jenkins RPM repository is added in /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo
